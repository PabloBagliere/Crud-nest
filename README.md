# CRUD NEST.JS - GRAFPHQL - TYPEORM

Basic CRUD with 4 technologies, made to be able to use base for any other project.

## Technologies

The technologies used are the following:

- [Nest.js] : Used to handle requests
- [Typeorm] : ORM used to connect to the database 
- [Graphql] : used to respond to requests
- [Graphql-Apollo]: clarification is used because nest.js uses it internally

clarification I am not an expert in these technologies and I am learning these technogies
